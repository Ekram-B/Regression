For this assignment, the task is to consider the problem of basis function regression. The issues of overfitting,
generalization and Bayesian prediction will be explored. This’ll be done by considering a few different datasets and using a set of
polynomial basis functions. I.E., φ i (x) = x i−1 for i = 1, . . . , D and we will consider different values of D.
